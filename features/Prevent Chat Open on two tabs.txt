<script>
    localStorage.cpages = Date.now();
    window.addEventListener('storage', function (e) {
        if(e.key == "cpages") {
            localStorage.npage = Date.now();
        }
        if(e.key == "npage") {
            alert('place your code here and make something cool to let them know they have 2 chat tab open');
        }
    }, false);
</script>
